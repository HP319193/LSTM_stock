LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory Networks. It is a type of recurrent neural network that is commonly used for regression and time series forecasting in machine learning. It can memorize data for long periods, which differentiates LSTM neural networks from other neural networks. If you want to learn how to predict stock prices with LSTM, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of stock price prediction with LSTM using Python.
